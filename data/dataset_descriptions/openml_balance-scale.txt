The Balance Scale Weight & Distance Database contains examples of balance scale experiments, categorized as 'tip to the right', 'tip to the left', or 'balanced'. The dataset includes 4 attributes: left weight, left distance, right weight, and right distance. The class is determined by the greater of (left-distance * left-weight) and (right-distance * right-weight), or if they are equal, it's balanced.
