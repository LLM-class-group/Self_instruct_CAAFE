The Eucalyptus Soil Conservation dataset aims to identify the best seedlots for soil conservation in seasonally dry hill country. It contains 20 attributes, including site information, tree characteristics, and a class label for utility rating.

Critical features:
1. DBH - best diameter base height (cm)
2. Ht - height (m)
3. Surv - survival
4. Utility - utility rating

Note: The dataset has missing values and inconsistent recording procedures across trials, which may affect the analysis.
