The dataset contains 255,168 instances, representing the endgame configurations of Tic-Tac-Toe games where 'x' plays first. Each instance is described by 9 binary features (1-9) representing the state of the 9 squares on the board, with values {x, o, b} indicating whether the square is occupied by 'x', 'o', or is blank, respectively. The target variable is a binary class {positive, negative} indicating whether 'x' has won the game or not.
