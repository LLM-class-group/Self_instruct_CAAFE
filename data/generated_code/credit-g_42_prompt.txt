The dataframe `df` is loaded and in memory. Columns are also named attributes.
Description of the dataset in `df` (column dtypes might be inaccurate):
"
The German Credit dataset contains 20 features that describe customers and classify them as good or bad credit risks. The dataset has a cost matrix, where misclassifying a good customer as bad has a cost of 5, and misclassifying a bad customer as good has a cost of 1. The features include:
1. Status of existing checking account
2. Duration in months
3. Credit history
4. Purpose of credit
5. Credit amount
6. Status of savings account/bonds
7. Present employment
8. Installment rate
9. Personal status and sex
10. Other debtors/guarantors
11. Present residence
12. Property
13. Age
14. Other installment plans
15. Housing
16. Number of existing credits
17. Job
18. People being liable to provide maintenance
19. Telephone
20. Foreign worker"

This code, written by an expert data scientist, adds new columns to the dataset to improve downstream classification (e.g., XGBoost) predicting "class".
These columns incorporate real-world knowledge through feature combinations, transformations, and aggregations. Ensure all used columns exist. 
Consider datatypes and meanings of classes. The code also performs feature selection by dropping redundant columns to avoid overfitting. The classifier will be trained and evaluated on accuracy. Added columns can be reused, dropped columns cannot.

Code formatting for each added column:
```python
# (Feature name and description)
# Usefulness: (Description why this adds useful real world knowledge to classify "class" according to dataset description and attributes.)
# Input samples: (Three samples of the columns used in the following code, e.g. 'checking_status': [3, 0, 0], 'duration': [30.0, 30.0, 48.0], ...)
(Some pandas code using checking_status', 'duration', ... to add a new column for each row in df)
```end

Code formatting for dropping columns:
```python
# Explanation why the column XX is dropped
df.drop(columns=['XX'], inplace=True)
```end

Each codeblock generates exactly one useful column and can drop unused columns (Feature selection).
Each codeblock ends with ```end and starts with "```python"
