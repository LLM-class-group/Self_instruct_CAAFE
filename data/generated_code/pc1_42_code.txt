# Usefulness: Halstead volume is a measure of the complexity of the software, which can be indicative of defects

# Halstead difficulty
# Usefulness: Halstead difficulty is a measure of the complexity of the software, which can be indicative of defects
# Input samples: loc: [109.0, 9.0, 91.0], v(g): [21.0, 4.0, 15.0], E: [72282.68, 0.0, 72282.68]
